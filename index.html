    <!-- description -->
     <p>Contrary to popular belief, Indian halwa is different from Middle Eastern halva, which is a candy made primarily from sesame seeds.

Halwa is a yummy dessert that is reserved for celebratory occasions. It isn’t difficult to make, but it does tend to take a bit of time. If you’d like to make gajar ka halwa more of a regular occurrence, consider using one of my genius shortcuts listed below!

It is a popular sweet made in North India, and it is especially popular during winters. The traditional recipe is made with only carrots, whole (full-fat) milk, ghee and sugar; there’s no need for khoya (evaporated milk solids) or condensed milk.

If you prefer using either khoya or milkmaid (sweetened condensed milk), skip to the appropriate section below to learn how!

I prefer to use red Delhi carrots to make the halwa, as they are tender and juicy. That said, you can use any carrots – red, orange, or even black – so long as they are not fibrous, stringy, or hard.

I still remember winter evenings when the house filled with the cozy aroma of grated carrots bubbling in creamy, simmering milk. My mother stirred patiently, never rushing the simmer; that slow magic is what I have captured in this recipe.

One of the reasons that I love making this halwa is that it has a pretty long shelf life. I can make a batch that’ll last for upwards of 10 days in the fridge, meaning we always have something sweet to snack on after our meals.
